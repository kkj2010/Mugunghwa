# MUGUNGHWA

###### Why Mugunghwa?

**Mugunghwa kkoci pieot seumnida** also known as  __"Red Light, Green Light"__ from Squid Game on Netflix, is a childhood game widely played in South Korea. The song of "mugunghwa kkoci pieot seumnida" plays during the game. The 'mugunghwa' (hibiscus) is not only the national flower of South Korea but also the meaning of my name. In the song, “kkoci pieot seumnida” means that the flower has bloomed. 


## DESCRIPTION
In the original game, the "it" person sings the song and as soon as they finish singing, they look back and the players must not move. In this game, your goal is to get your player to the finish line and collect as many coins as possible on the way. The "it" person will stand at the finish line. The player can only move when the "it" person doesn't look back. The speed at which the "it" is not consistent every time. Therefore, the player won't be able to predict when to move.
